- Difference between loosely-typed and strictly-typed
- Run time error vs compile-time error
- Typescript is syntactical superset of JS
    - backward compatible 
    - TS never runs at all
    - TS is transpiled down to JS and that JS is run by browser and Nodejs
    - TS compilers
        - tsc (official)
        - esbuild
        - swc
    
- Using TS
    - create a ts config file using 'tsc --int' command
    - type is assigned using :dataType
    - "tsc -b": to compile ts file to js file

- Concepts
    - Assigning types
        - to variables 
        - to inputs
        - to returns
        - to callbacks
        - to objects -> using interfaces
    - Type inference: 

- TS config file
    - target
    - rootDir
    - outDir
    - noImplicitAny
    - removeComments

- Interfaces
    - how to define interfaces
    - opitional values in interface
    - implementing interfaces as a class
