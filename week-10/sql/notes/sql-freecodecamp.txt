BASIC SQL 

- What is a Databse(DB)?
    - Any collection of related information that can be stored in different ways.

- (Database Management System) DBMS
    - A special software that allows to create and maintain databases.
        - adds security to databases
        - much easier to maintain large amounts of information 
        - can interact with programming languages
        - makes it more scalable 
        - allows for CRUD operation 

- Relational vs Non-Relational Databases 

    - Relational 
        - Data is organized into tables, each having colums and rows, where each column represents a single attribute and each row (has a unique identifier) represents a single entry.

        - Relational Database Management System (RDBMS)
            - Special softwares that allow to create and maintain a relational database. 
            - mySQL, postgreSQL and the like.
            - RDBMS use a special language that is called "Structured Query Language (SQL)."

    - Non-relational
        - Data is orgranized into anything but a table. 
        - Any database, that is not relational comes under non-ralational.
        - Documents (JSON, XML, etc.), Graphs, key-value pairs.

        - Non-relational database management system (NRDBMS) 
            - Speial softwares that allow to create and maintain a non-relational database.
            - mongoDB, firebase, etc. 


- Query
    - A query is a request that is made to the DBMS or a set of instructions that are given to DBMS.
    - That request could be any of the four CRUD operations.
    - Queries, in RDBMS are written in SQL or in the language that is specified by the RDMS. 

- Keys:
    - Primary key: a unique value that identifies a row in a table.
    - Surrogate key: a primary key that has no meaning or significance outside of that table. 
    - Natural key: a primary key that has some significance and meaning in the real world.
    - Foreign key: a primary key of another table. Allow to connect tables and form relationships.
    - Composite key: a primary key that is made up of two attibutes because each attribute (or column) doesn't consist all unique values and hence cannot be the column of primary keys. But together, the two columns now have values that become unique keys for each row/entry.


- SQL Basics

    - Structured Query Language is a language that RDBMS use to create and maintain database and also allow to administrative tasks.
    - Combination of 4 languages:
        - Data Query Language (DQL): used to query the database for information.
        - Data Control Language (DCL): used to constrol access to data in database.
        - Data Defintion Language (DDL): used to defines schemas in database.
        - Data Manipulation Language (DML): used for inserting, updating and deleting data in the database. 

- Basic Datatypes in SQL
    - INT
    - DECIMAL(T, D)   (T - total number of digits, D - total number of decimal digits in T)
    - VARCHAR(1)
    - BLOB
    - DATE    ('YYYY-MM-DD')
    - TIMESTAP    ('YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS')

- SQL Commands
    1 - Create tables and define structure for the database.
    2 - Insert data into the table
    3 - Update and Delete
    4 - Conditional inserting, getting
