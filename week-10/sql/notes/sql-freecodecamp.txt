BASIC SQL 

- What is a Databse(DB)?
    - Any collection of related information that can be stored in different ways.

- (Database Management System) DBMS
    - A special software that allows to create and maintain databases.
        - adds security to databases
        - much easier to maintain large amounts of information 
        - can interact with programming languages
        - makes it more scalable 
        - allows for CRUD operation 

- Relational vs Non-Relational Databases 

    - Relational 
        - Data is organized into tables, each having colums and rows, where each row has a unique identifier.

        - Relational Database Management System (RDBMS)
            - Special softwares that allow to create and maintain a relational database. 
            - mySQL, postgreSQL and the like.
            - RDBMS use a special language that is called "Structured Query Language (SQL)."

    - Non-relational
        - Data is orgranized into anything but a table. 
        - Any database, that is not relational comes under non-ralational.
        - Documents (JSON, XML, etc.), Graphs, key-value pairs.

        - Non-relational database management system (NRDBMS) 
            - Speial softwares that allow to create and maintain a non-relational database.
            - mongoDB, firebase, etc. 


- Query
    - A query is a request that is made to the DBMS. 
    - That request could be any of the four CRUD operations.
    - Queries, in RDBMS are written in SQL or in the language that is specified by the RDMS.
