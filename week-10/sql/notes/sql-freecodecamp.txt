BASIC SQL 

- What is a Databse(DB)?
    - Any collection of related information that can be stored in different ways.

- (Database Management System) DBMS
    - A special software that allows to create and maintain databases.
        - adds security to databases
        - much easier to maintain large amounts of information 
        - can interact with programming languages
        - makes it more scalable 
        - allows for CRUD operation 

- Relational vs Non-Relational Databases 

    - Relational 
        - Data is organized into tables, each having colums and rows, where each column represents a single attribute and each row (has a unique identifier) represents a single entry.

        - Relational Database Management System (RDBMS)
            - Special softwares that allow to create and maintain a relational database. 
            - mySQL, postgreSQL and the like.
            - RDBMS use a special language that is called "Structured Query Language (SQL)."

    - Non-relational
        - Data is orgranized into anything but a table. 
        - Any database, that is not relational comes under non-ralational.
        - Documents (JSON, XML, etc.), Graphs, key-value pairs.

        - Non-relational database management system (NRDBMS) 
            - Speial softwares that allow to create and maintain a non-relational database.
            - mongoDB, firebase, etc. 


- Query
    - A query is a request that is made to the DBMS or a set of instructions that are given to DBMS.
    - That request could be any of the four CRUD operations.
    - Queries, in RDBMS are written in SQL or in the language that is specified by the RDMS. 

- Keys:
    - Primary key: a unique value that identifies a row in a table.
    - Surrogate key: a primary key that has no meaning or significance outside of that table. 
    - Natural key: a primary key that has some significance and meaning in the real world.
    - Foreign key: a primary key of another table. Allow to connect tables and form relationships.
    - Composite key: a primary key that is made up of two attibutes because each attribute (or column) doesn't consist of all unique values and hence cannot be the column of primary keys. But together, the two columns now have values that become unique keys for each row/entry.


- SQL Basics

    - Structured Query Language is a language that RDBMS use to create and maintain database and also allow to administrative tasks.
    - Combination of 4 languages:
        - Data Query Language (DQL): used to query the database for information.
        - Data Control Language (DCL): used to constrol access to data in database.
        - Data Defintion Language (DDL): used to defines schemas in database.
        - Data Manipulation Language (DML): used for inserting, updating and deleting data in the database. 

- Basic Datatypes in SQL
    - INT
    - DECIMAL(T, D)   (T - total number of digits, D - total number of decimal digits in T)
    - VARCHAR(1)
    - BLOB
    - DATE    ('YYYY-MM-DD')
    - TIMESTAP    ('YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS')

- SQL Commands

 1 - To create a table 
 	- CREATE TABLE tableName (colName1 DATATYPE1, colName2 DATATYPE2);
 	- CREATE TABLE users (name TEXT, age SMALLINT);
 
 2 - To add values into the table 
 	- INSERT INTO tableName (colName1, colName2) VALUES (value1, value2);
 	- INSERT INTO users (name, age) VALUES ('Devang', 25);
 
 3 - To select values from table 
 	- To select one
 		- SELECT colName1, colName2 FROM tableName;
 		- SELECT name FROM users;
 	- To select all
 		- SELECT * FROM tableName;
 		- SELECT * FROM users;
 
 4 - To alter the table 
 	- ALTER TABLE tableName ADD colName3 dataType3;
 	- ALTER TABLE users ADD score SMALLINT;
 
 5 - To update the table 
 	- UPDATE tableName SET colName3 = value3 WHERE colName1 = value1;
 	- UPDATE users SET score = 30 WHERE name = 'Devang';
 	
 6 - Conditional searches
 	- SELECT * FROM tableName WHERE anyCondition;
 	- SELECT * FROM users WHERE name = 'Devang';
 	
 	- Order by ascending or descending order
 		- SELECT * FORM tableName ORDER BY colName DESC/ASC;
 		- SEELCT * FROM users ORDER BY score ASC;
 		
 7 - Functions 
 	- average: AVG(colName)  --> SELECT AVG(score) FROM users;
 	- sum: SUM(colName)  --> SELECT SUM(score) FROM users;
 	- count: COUNT(colName)  --> SELECT COUNT(name) FROM users;
 	
 8 - Deleting and dropping
 	- To delete values from a table
 		- DELETE FROM tableName WHERE colName = value;
 		- DELETE FROM users WHERE name = 'Devang';
 		
 	- To delete the entire table 
 		- DROP TABLE tableName;
 		- DROP TABEL users;
 	 
 	- To delete entire single column
 		- ALTER TABLE tableName DROP COLUMN columnName;
 		- ALTER TABLE users DROP COLUMN name;
 		
 		for mutiple columns, use multiple DROP queries:
 		- ALTER TABLE users DROP COLUMN name DROP COLUMN email;
 	
 9 - General commands:
 	- SHOW TABLES: to show all tables in a database.
 	- SHOW DATABASES: to show all databases in a connection.
 	- SELECT DATABASE(): to show the database you are in.
 	
 	
 10 - Some datatype properties/contraints keywords
 	- UNIQUE
 	- NOT NULL
 	- AUTO_INCREMENT
 
 	
 	- LIMIT
 	- AND
 	- OR
 	- IN
 	- <> not equal to sign in SQL
