    - Installing and initializing Prisma

        - npx prisma init 
        - configure prisma 
            - add provider and url
    
    - Creating models
        - define the schema of all the model specific to the application
        - after creating model, migrate it and then create auto-generated clients 

    - Migrating
        - The database needs to know what tables would be inside it and what structure would they have. Migrations do that. 
        - npx prisma migrate dev -name <name>

    - Autogenerated clients
        - prisma needs to create js classes or functions that can let the nodejs communicate with the models defined in schema.prisma, hence being able to communicate with the actual db
            - npx prisma generate
