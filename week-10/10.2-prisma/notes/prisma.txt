- What is ORM 
- Why ORMs

- Prisma 
    - What
        - intuitive data model
        - automated migrations
            - what is a migration
        - type safety
        - auto-completion

    - Installing and initializing Prisma
        - npm install prisma 
        - npx prisma init 
        - configure prisma 
            - add provider and url
            - connection url:
                - url: postgresql://devang:Musicmylove@1234@localhost:5432/100xdevs-practice
	            - format: provider://username:password@host/databseName
	
	        (command to navigate to postgres user and db:  
                psql -h localhost -d postgres -U postgres)
    
    - Creating models
        - define the schema of all the model specific to the application
        - after creating model, migrate it and then create auto-generated clients 

    - Migrating
        - The database needs to know what tables would be inside it and what structure would they have. Migrations do that. 
        - npx prisma migrate dev -name <name>

    - Autogenerated clients
        - prisma needs to create js classes or functions that can let the nodejs communicate with the models defined in schema.prisma, hence being able to communicate with the actual db
            - npx prisma generate
        - using this client
            - running the command given above creates a new prisma client 
            - import {PrismaClient} from "@prisma/client";
            -  const prisma = new PrismaClient();
