## Storage

- Objects or content
- Object stores (AWS --> S3)
  - Simple stores
  - Buckets
  - Copying link and directly accessing is a bad practice

## Distribution

- CDN (Content Dilvery Networks)

  - source of truth
  - multiple servers (POPs -> Point of Presence)
  - caching

- Whenever you have object store, you also have a associated CDN with that object store.

- Why you should not deploy your backend using CDNs?
- Edge Networks
