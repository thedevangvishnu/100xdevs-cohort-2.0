// Practice declaring variables using var, let and const

var firstName = "Devang";
const age = 22;
console.log("My name is " + firstName + " and my age is " + age); // My name is Devang and my age is 22

let lastName = "Vishnu";
const isMarried = false;
isMarried = true; // will throw error becuase constants cannot be changed
console.log("My last name is " + lastName);
