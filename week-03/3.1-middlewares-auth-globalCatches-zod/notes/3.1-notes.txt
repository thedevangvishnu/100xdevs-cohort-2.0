3.1 - Middlewares, Authentication, Global catches and Zod

3.1.1 - Middlewares

    - How to do prechecks? Such as auth check or input validation?
    - How can a user send input?
        - query parameters
        - body
        - header

        - next();
        - app.use()
        
        
    - Assignments
    	- count the number of requests
    	- Find the average time your server is taking to handle requests
    	
3.1.2 - Global catches
	
	- app.use((err, req, res, next) => console.error(err))

3.1.3 - Zod

	- library used for input validation
	- create a "schema", which sort of a blueprint of how the input should look like and hence acts as the "lookup" for the validation
